# PollenClassification
A repoaitory to hold all Pollen Classification related files and models.

## To Do:

### Priority:
- ~~Model saving~~
- ~~Complete rework of "Going Modular" Chapter~~
- Inference function to run on "Unseen images".
- phisical train_test_split in order to use the dedicated test set for animations
- ~~Replicate TF model in Pytorch.../model.py~~
- Create more models
- Benchmark script to test inference (on saved models aswell)
- Yaml file to store all hyper and script parameters
- Frame script to launch multiple training scripts
- Hyper parameter optimization
- Transfer learning, using pretrained bases

### Nice to have:
- Async inference
- Cuda Nsight diagnostics
- Research Deployment methods
- Deploy model
- Make animation
