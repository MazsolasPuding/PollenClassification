- Model saving
- Complete rework of "Going Modular" Chapter
- Inference function to run on "Unseen images".
- phisical train_test_split in order to use the dedicated test set for animations
- Replicate TF model in Pytorch.../model.py
- Create more models
- Benchmark script to test inference (on saved models aswell)
